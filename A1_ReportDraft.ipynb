Given a data sample in 2D space which means it has 100 attributes if we can keep different wings for every sample of all the 100 attributes, we will sum them up and if we perform the same operation to all the data we basically transformed the data from high dimensional space to 1D space because all the data points becomes one number. We also will create another model which works the same way but with a different set of co-efficients we will transform the data to 2D space and how to create a co-efficients by create a co-efficient matrix so that we can transform the data into spaces.

Linear Discriminant Analysis and Principle Component Analysis are linear transformation techniques where in LDA is a supervised learning algorithm whereas PCA ignores the class label. However, the PCA is generally used in dimensionality reduction but not as a classification method since there will be no correlation between the features when applied on data, instead it can be used to improve the performance of LDA. The idea described in this paper is to develop a face recognition algorithm that is not sensitive to the variation in the direction of the lightning, number of light resources and facial expressions.

        "Face Recognition is one of the most challenging tasks in the image analysis and pattern recognition field wherein the samples of the images are taken, classified and compared with other images in the database. (Pratibha Sukhija, et al., 2016). The face is a deformable object, and expressions in faces are available in a substantial form of viable configurations. Recognition of face is done by comparing the features which represents the variation in face structure, shape and different face attributes like distance between the eye and node and eyebrow width and the accuracy of the classification is expected to be high. Faces tend to change over years and several features such as wrinkles, skin color and pores sagging are to be eliminated. The entire face recognition process is influenced by several factors such as pose, light illumination, reflectance and shape, thus making it more difficult to predict. \n",
        "\n",
        "Few Challenges while during the face recognition are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "-\tThe images that are taken vary such as tilted, upside down every time due to the camera-face pose.\n",
        "-\tWhen an image is taken, factors such as lightning, pose and camera’s position tends to  differs each time that in turn makes it difficult to do the prediction\n",
        "-\tWhen taking pictures, a person from the same view point and expression appears different under various lightning conditions.\n",
        "-\tImages that are not taken years ago may not match with the images in database that makes it difficult to recognize.\n",
        "\n",
        "Several algorithms have been introduced to solve the problem of detecting the faces and enhancing the accuracy of the recognized faces. The first face recognition algorithm was introduced in 1960’s wherein the human face was detected using the geometric features. In 1991, Turk expanded the concept of Eigen faces on identifying how to detect the faces within images which led to the introduction of automatic face recognition.\n",
        "\n",
        "This paper attempts to provide a more error free face detection and recognition method from various images which are not sensitive to huge variations in facial expressions and lightning from various sources. The idea of the paper is to linearly project an image into a subspace which does not deviate more from its path and not produce self-shadowing. To achieve this, various linear projection algorithms such as Fisher face, Eigen face were used that projected images in a low dimensional space under severe variation in lightning and facial expressions. Projections are made orthogonal to the class scatter by differentiating the variations in lightning and facial expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper is divided into various sections wherein the first section of the paper deals with the problems while during the face detection and how the detection can be made easier. To solve this problem, four methods were compared under various lightning conditions and determined which method can be used to make an accurate and error- free prediction. In the second section, assuming that the image is in high dimensional space, a training set with the labeled set of images and a test set that is not labeled is taken to do the comparison.\n",
        "Considering the hypotheses to be tested and the expected performance from each algorithm, the data that has variations in lightning are selected. In the third section, experiments are conducted under variations in lightning, facial expression and eye wear. Comparative Study is done to determine if the person is wearing glasses and identifying the error rate with Eigen faces and Fisher faces algorithms.\n",

Classification of data and dimensionality reduction can be done using LDA and PCA. Tests prove that LDA shows outstanding performance when tested on a given set of data, provided the within-class frequencies are unequal. PCA focuses more on feature recognition whereas LDA focuses more on data classification, thereby, trying to provide more class separability and arrives at a conclusion between the given classes.\n",

        "The goal of the paper is to develop a face recognition algorithm that is not sensitive to light variations and facial expressions. The formation of the paper is very good as the author has provided a comparative study on various algorithms that can be used for face recognition by addressing the drawbacks for each rather concluding the best method for performing face detection. The author begins the study by stating that, since the images produce self-shadowing and are not truly Lambertian surface, the image should be linearly projected into a subspace which discounts all the regions that produce large deviation. To make the linear projection to a low dimensional subspace, Fisher’s linear Discriminant and Eigenfaces techniques are used. The author has taken two databases to perform the prediction; Harvard and Yale Face databases. He has not considered the pose variations of a person to be one of his characteristics for prediction as it may be difficult to analyze under different lightning conditions. To choose the best method, he has provided a comparative study on four different algorithms for face detection that are as follows:\n",

He has identified that the normalization process is independent of light sources wherein there would not exist clustering if the image in test and training set are considered under various lightning conditions. One major disadvantage addressed in the paper is the time taken to correlate an image in the training test to test set which would reduce the computation time. The author has also addressed the cost and storage as one of the most important factors for not considering this method to do the recognition. \n",
        "\n",
        "The next method which is discussed in the paper is Eigenfaces for performing face recognition wherein the image is linearly projected into a linear sub space. The basic idea is to calculate the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, and total the original data by a linear combination of the leading eigenvectors. The author has made a detailed study on how the eigen vectors can be obtained with the given samples. The Eigenface method uses the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction which results in projection across all the classes. In the PCA-based face recognition technique, 1D image vectors are obtained from the transformation of 2D images.This, inturn leads to the complexity of computing the covariance matrix due to the large size. However, the eigenvectors are determined by the covariance matrix and accuracy is not sustained when approaches change.\n",
        "\n",
        "The major drawback here is since the scatter across all classes is high, PCA retains the unwanted variations that occur due to lightning and facial expressions which result in poor clustering among the projected point across a linear subspace. The author, by pointing out the statement “While choosing projections, PCA considers the unwanted variations due to facial expression and lightning” expresses his interest to extend the research to the most effective algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, the author had put forth a strong opinion that neither of the two methods discussed above has made full use of the fact that, “For any particular face, the image lies in 3D subspace assuming it’s the Lambertian surface without shadowing. In the next method, the author has explored to recognize the Lambertian surface that is insensitive to various lightning conditions by taking three images and constructing three vectors that have the same dimensionality as the images in training set.\n",

        "The author states that to perform recognition, shortest distance must be taken by computing the range of an image to linear subspace. Though the Linear subspace is the effective method, the author has firmly stated that linear separability could be preserved even though the dimensionality reduction is performed with linear projection. Additionally, he says that better recognition could be achieved using class specific linear method or Fisher’s Linear Discriminant method that shapes the scatter for better classification.\n",

        "The paper that is formulated is very informative and easily understandable. The author has provided us a clear understanding of the different methods for face recognition by postulating a theory and proving it with the mathematical equations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of every technique, he has then applied the equations on the data set to test the effectiveness. The literature flow is very efficient, and any beginners in the field of machine learning would be able to understand easily. The author began his survey by initially identifying the problem and dataset. Next, he described how the data set is to be classified and gave a brief idea on Principle Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis. He then put forth the observations that are to be considered and suggested four methods for recognition. Additionally, the author provided a detailed explanation of the preferred methods and explained how one outweighs another.\n",

        "He kept in mind about the how the image is to be projected before starting the research and made observations earlier that led him to apply the methods on the given data set effectively. He also explained the advantages of using the algorithm and the behavior when it’s applied on the assumed data set to determine the effectiveness. Throughout the paper, the author was very clear on which parameters should be chosen since few parameters may result in complex analysis. The innovation in the paper was very high as he made an effective comparative study on various machine learning algorithms to solve a real world problem that was later used for various applications such as Medical Report Analysis, finger print recognition.\n"

However in few parts the author missed giving a detailed explanation why the particular explanation why the particular feature are only chosen and how different it would be if some other features are selected. Though the error rate is considered as one of the parameter for selecting the best algorithm and was observed to be very less in Fisher face method, the paper did not provide clarity on how the error rate could be decreased in the other methods apart from decreasing the principal components. The author had arrived at a conclusion that Fisher face method could be the best algorithm for a given data set as the error rate is very less.\n",

Firstly, the author has attempted to check the algorithm behavior under variation lightning conditions as the images appears differently when the lightning directions are changed. From the experiment it is very clear that the author attempts to understand the lightning effects for one single pose and achieve a solution. He has conducted two experiments such as extrapolation and interpolation on the dataset. However, the author failed to address the drawback of doing extrapolation on a given data set. The extrapolation could sometimes produce bias estimates when the region to be extrapolated is far from the given range of data set. The author has provided a detailed explanation that the method works well only when lightning is frontal else performance difference is observed. In this experiment, the author neither did attempt to resolve the issue of same face appearing twice nor address the change in background problem while doing the classification.\n",

        "In the next experiment, the author has addressed the fact that the error rate tends to increase when the images do not lie in a linear subspace by considering the variations in facial expressions and analysis is performed. The author also had addressed the problem of overfitting in the recognition and had removed those images that cause the problem. The author had taken all efforts to understand the variation in facial expression and lightning by performing analysis in a different ways; the first technique is to close crop the image to a particular portion and the second technique is doing recognition in a full image. From the results, it is observed that Fisher faces performed well when the detection is done for a full face since the image is broken into pixels when it is cropped , that acts as a feature for that instance. The complexity of finding the projection of a face space is not discussed anywhere by the author. Various study states that, processing time is huge to calculate the within-class scatter ratio and the dimension of projection requires a large storage space that results in more computation time.\n",

He had also applied cross-validation technique to balance the data set and to identify the recognition rates. He concluded stating that the Fisher face method could be applied on the person wearing glasses and ignoring the other characteristics and achieves an error rate of 5.3%.\n"
