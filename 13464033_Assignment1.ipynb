        "The selected paper, as it goes by the topic, is about a machine learning algorithm called Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) /Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and illustrates the effective way of selecting the features, transforming the data to a high dimensional space and using the algorithms on a selected dataset to perform face recognition. Linear Discriminant Analysis and Principle Component Analysis are linear transformation techniques wherein LDA is a supervised learning algorithm, whereas PCA ignores the class label. However, the PCA is generally used in dimensionality reduction but not as a classification method since there will be no correlation between the features when applied on data; instead it can be used to improve the performance of LDA. The idea described in this paper is to develop a face recognition algorithm that is not sensitive to the variation in the direction of the lightning, number of light resources and facial expressions. The author has attempted to solve the face recognition problem using several pattern classification techniques namely Correlation, Eigenfaces, Linear subspaces, and Fisherspaces and provided a comparative study on the algorithms by modifying the features to identify the feature set and algorithm to solve the face recognition problem."

        "Face Recognition is one of the most challenging tasks in the image analysis and pattern recognition field wherein the samples of the images are taken, classified, and compared with other images in the database (Sukhija, Behal & Singh 2016). The face is a deformable object, and expressions in faces are available in a substantial form of viable configurations. Recognition of face is done by comparing the features which represent the variation in face structure, shape and different face attributes like distance between the eye and node and eyebrow width and the accuracy of the classification is expected to be high. Faces tend to change over years, and several features such as wrinkles, skin color and pores sagging are to be eliminated. The entire face recognition process is influenced by several factors such as pose, light illumination, reflectance, and shape, thus making it more difficult to predict (Bhatia, Lilhore & Agrawal 2017).\n",

The formation of the article is magnificent as the author has provided a comparative study on various algorithms that can be used for face recognition by addressing the drawbacks for each instead concluding the best method for performing face detection. The author begins the study by stating that, since the images produce self-shadowing and are not genuinely Lambertian surface, the image should be linearly projected into a subspace which discounts all the regions that produce significant deviation. To make the linear projection to a low dimensional subspace, Fisher’s linear Discriminant and Eigenfaces techniques are used. The author has taken two databases to perform the prediction; Harvard and Yale Face databases. He has not considered the pose variations of a person to be one of his characteristics for prediction as it may be difficult to analyze under different lighting conditions. To choose the best method, he has provided a comparative study on four different algorithms namely Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces.\n",

He has identified that the normalization process is independent of light sources wherein there would not exist clustering if the image in test and training set are considered under various lighting conditions.\n",
        "One major disadvantage addressed in the paper is the time taken to correlate an image in the training test to test set which would reduce the computation time. The author has also addressed the cost and storage as one of the most essential factors for not considering this method to do the recognition.The next method, which is discussed in the paper, is Eigenfaces for performing face recognition wherein the image is linearly projected into a linear subspace.The basic idea is to calculate the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix and total the original data by a linear combination of the leading eigenvectors. \n",

        "The author has made a detailed study on how the eigenvectors can be obtained with the given samples. The Eigenface method uses the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction which results in projection across all the classes. In the PCA-based face recognition technique, 1D image vectors are obtained from the transformation of 2D images.This in turn leads to the complexity of computing the covariance matrix due to the large size. However, the eigenvectors are determined by the covariance matrix and accuracy is not sustained when approaches change.\n",

        "The significant drawback here is since the scatter across all classes is high; PCA retains the unwanted variations that occur due to lightning and facial expressions which result in weak clustering among the projected point across a linear subspace. The author, by pointing out the statement “While choosing projections, PCA considers the unwanted variations due to facial expression and lightning” expresses his interest to extend the research to the most effective algorithm.\n",

The Linear subspace method produced better results, but the author has firmly stated that linear separability could be preserved even though the dimensionality reduction is performed with linear projection. Additionally, he says that better recognition could be achieved using class specific linear method or Fisher’s Linear Discriminant method that shapes the scatter for better classification(Sugiyama 2006)\n",

The author has provided us a clear understanding of the different methods for face recognition by postulating a theory and proving it with the mathematical equations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of every technique, he has then applied the equations on the data set to test the effectiveness. The literature flow is very efficient, and any beginners in the field of machine learning would be able to understand easily. The author began his survey by initially identifying the problem and dataset. Next, he described how the data set is to be classified and gave a brief idea on Principle Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis. He then put forth the observations that are to be considered and suggested four methods for recognition. Additionally, the author provided a detailed explanation of the preferred methods and explained how one outweighs another.\n",

He also explained the advantages of using the algorithm and the behavior when applied to the assumed data set to determine the effectiveness. Throughout the paper, the author was obvious on which parameters should be chosen since few parameters may result in complex analysis. The innovation in the article was very high as he made a compelling comparative study on various machine learning algorithms to solve a real-world problem that was later used for various applications such as face.\n"

Firstly, the author has attempted to check the algorithm behavior under variation in lightning conditions as the images appear differently when the lightning directions are changed. From the experiment, it is very clear that the author attempted to understand the lightning effects for one single pose and achieved a solution. Later, two tests such as extrapolation and interpolation were applied on the dataset. Extrapolation is usually done for identifying the data points beyond the given range and Interpolation is done to estimate the unknown values. However, the extrapolation could sometimes produce bias estimates when the region to be extrapolated is very far from the given range of data set. The author has provided a detailed explanation that the method works well only when lightning is frontal else performance difference is observed. It has been observed that the linear subspace and the fisher face method had similar error rates, but the linear subspace consumed lot of memory and required more computation time.

The author had taken all efforts to understand the variation in facial expression and lightning by performing analysis in different ways and the experiment was done removing the glasses. The first technique is to close crop the image to a particular portion and the second technique is doing recognition in a full image. From the results, it is observed that Fisher faces performed well when the detection is done for a full face since the image is broken into pixels when it is cropped , that acts as a feature for that instance. The complexity of finding the projection of a face space is not discussed anywhere by the author. The various study states that, processing time is vast to calculate the within-class scatter ratio and the dimension of projection requires an ample storage space that results in more computation time.\n",

He concluded stating that the Fisher face method could be applied to the person wearing glasses by ignoring the other characteristics and achieves an error rate of 5.3% (Wu et al. 2010)."
